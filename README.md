# Hyperledger Composer Sample Applications

:warning: :warning: :warning:

**As of the 29th August 2019, the Hyperledger Composer project is in deprecated status. None of the maintainers are actively developing new features. None of the maintainers are actively providing support via GitHub issues. However, if you wish to submit code changes via pull requests, these will be merged.**

**It is highly recommended that you use Hyperledger Fabric v1.4+ instead, which features significant improvements to the developer experience, including a new programming model.**

**More information available here: [What's new in Hyperledger Fabric v1.4](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/whatsnew.html#improved-programming-model-for-developing-applications)**

:warning: :warning: :warning:

The repository contains sample applications written against the [Hyperledger Composer](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/)

Currently this contains the code and scripts for the ['DigitalProperty-App'](./packages/digitalproperty-app/README.md) tutorial - see the README in that directory for instructions on how to install.

To install this repo and find out more about the sample applications, run (from this directory):
```

npm install
node info.js

```


We welcome Pull Requests for new applications - please see the [contributing notes](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

*IMPORTANT NOTE*  The Digital Property ("getting-started") sample CLI-based application is the main route for people to get started with Hyperledger Composer - please exercise care when changing it!
